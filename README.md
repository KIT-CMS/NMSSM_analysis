# mssm-htt-legacy-analysis
In this repository all software necessary for the MSSM HTT Legacy analysis starting from flat n-tuple level is stored.
The software uses the ntuple_processor code included as submodule of the main repository.
This software is based written for python3.6 and uses RDataFrames.
